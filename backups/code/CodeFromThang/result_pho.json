She asked how much 3 or 4 was and didn't even bother to say it for me. She said she couldn't see the way. Borrow glasses from people at the table to watch for a while before paying. The shop's suggestion is that when I hand over the phone, I conveniently read the price by 1.\nAfter I finished paying, I asked for more, but after I answered, they didn't bring it up. When I called again, they ignored me. Not good experience."
