There are locals walking around in hoodies and jeans in this weather y‚Äôall are so different‚Ä¶\n\nWe sat upstairs and ordered Bun Cha with a spring roll (100k vnd or $4 usd), as it is essentially the only thing on the menu here. While this place is definitely geared more toward Westerners, the Bun Cha still SLAPPED. A Top 3 Bun Cha we had on our trip, and it‚Äôs definitely not 1 or 3‚Ä¶\n\nSome of the other Bun Cha we had was a little too sweet for me, but this one was perfect. Dipping the rice vermicelli noodles into the fish sauce while grabbing a piece of the minced pork shoulder before shoving it into your mouth is a spiritual experience, unique to Vietnam.\n\nThis trip to Vietnam has made me fall in love with Bun Cha. To be quite honest, I didn‚Äôt even know it existed until that episode of Parts Unknown where Obama and Bourdain ate it together in Hanoi. Even after that, I‚Äôd never tried it and kind of forgot about it. I‚Äôd stick to my normal choices at Vietnamese restaurants in the US of Pho or Banh Mi.\n\nBun Cha will be my go to order at Vietnamese restaurants back home, we Bun Cha All Stars now!\n\nIG @jnov_\nTiktok @jnov_reviews"

I realised there were always grab food and shoppee food drivers ( equivalent to uber eats ) drivers lining to waiting outside of the restaurant to pick up their orders which meant that the locals loved the restaurant. I did another take away because it was THAT GOOD and they packed it so nicely so they did not disappoint :>>\n\nHIGHLY RECONMEND !!!!"

There are locals walking around in hoodies and jeans in this weather y‚Äôall are so different‚Ä¶\n\nWe sat upstairs and ordered Bun Cha with a spring roll (100k vnd or $4 usd), as it is essentially the only thing on the menu here. While this place is definitely geared more toward Westerners, the Bun Cha still SLAPPED. A Top 3 Bun Cha we had on our trip, and it‚Äôs definitely not 1 or 3‚Ä¶\n\nSome of the other Bun Cha we had was a little too sweet for me, but this one was perfect. Dipping the rice vermicelli noodles into the fish sauce while grabbing a piece of the minced pork shoulder before shoving it into your mouth is a spiritual experience, unique to Vietnam.\n\nThis trip to Vietnam has made me fall in love with Bun Cha. To be quite honest, I didn‚Äôt even know it existed until that episode of Parts Unknown where Obama and Bourdain ate it together in Hanoi. Even after that, I‚Äôd never tried it and kind of forgot about it. I‚Äôd stick to my normal choices at Vietnamese restaurants in the US of Pho or Banh Mi.\n\nBun Cha will be my go to order at Vietnamese restaurants back home, we Bun Cha All Stars now!\n\nIG @jnov_\nTiktok @jnov_reviews"

The menu was limited to bun cha and spring rolls, but that's okay, they should stick to their specialty because they are very good at making bun cha. I hope they become very successful for many years because I'm already excited to come back to this restaurant when I visit Vietnam again!"

Only complaint is that the service was a bit pushy. the waitresss stood at our table until we ordered despite asking for a few minutes twice."

This restaurant has perfected the dish and I couldn't even be more impressed ! I realised there were always grab food and shoppee food drivers ( equivalent to uber eats ) drivers lining to waiting outside of the restaurant to pick up their orders which meant that the locals loved the restaurant. I did another take away because it was THAT GOOD and they packed it so nicely so they did not disappoint :>>\n\nHIGHLY RECONMEND !!!!"

There are locals walking around in hoodies and jeans in this weather y‚Äôall are so different‚Ä¶\n\nWe sat upstairs and ordered Bun Cha with a spring roll (100k vnd or $4 usd), as it is essentially the only thing on the menu here. While this place is definitely geared more toward Westerners, the Bun Cha still SLAPPED. A Top 3 Bun Cha we had on our trip, and it‚Äôs definitely not 1 or 3‚Ä¶\n\nSome of the other Bun Cha we had was a little too sweet for me, but this one was perfect. Dipping the rice vermicelli noodles into the fish sauce while grabbing a piece of the minced pork shoulder before shoving it into your mouth is a spiritual experience, unique to Vietnam.\n\nThis trip to Vietnam has made me fall in love with Bun Cha. To be quite honest, I didn‚Äôt even know it existed until that episode of Parts Unknown where Obama and Bourdain ate it together in Hanoi. Even after that, I‚Äôd never tried it and kind of forgot about it. I‚Äôd stick to my normal choices at Vietnamese restaurants in the US of Pho or Banh Mi.\n\nBun Cha will be my go to order at Vietnamese restaurants back home, we Bun Cha All Stars now!\n\nIG @jnov_\nTiktok @jnov_reviews"

Their bun cha is amazing! The orders were served very quickly and very hot. The staff was very friendly, and it was nice seeing them prepare the meat on the spot and cook it fresh. The menu was limited to bun cha and spring rolls, but that's okay, they should stick to their specialty because they are very good at making bun cha. I hope they become very successful for many years because I'm already excited to come back to this restaurant when I visit Vietnam again!"

I realised there were always grab food and shoppee food drivers ( equivalent to uber eats ) drivers lining to waiting outside of the restaurant to pick up their orders which meant that the locals loved the restaurant. I did another take away because it was THAT GOOD and they packed it so nicely so they did not disappoint :>>\n\nHIGHLY RECONMEND !!!!"

There are locals walking around in hoodies and jeans in this weather y‚Äôall are so different‚Ä¶\n\nWe sat upstairs and ordered Bun Cha with a spring roll (100k vnd or $4 usd), as it is essentially the only thing on the menu here. While this place is definitely geared more toward Westerners, the Bun Cha still SLAPPED. A Top 3 Bun Cha we had on our trip, and it‚Äôs definitely not 1 or 3‚Ä¶\n\nSome of the other Bun Cha we had was a little too sweet for me, but this one was perfect. Dipping the rice vermicelli noodles into the fish sauce while grabbing a piece of the minced pork shoulder before shoving it into your mouth is a spiritual experience, unique to Vietnam.\n\nThis trip to Vietnam has made me fall in love with Bun Cha. To be quite honest, I didn‚Äôt even know it existed until that episode of Parts Unknown where Obama and Bourdain ate it together in Hanoi. Even after that, I‚Äôd never tried it and kind of forgot about it. I‚Äôd stick to my normal choices at Vietnamese restaurants in the US of Pho or Banh Mi.\n\nBun Cha will be my go to order at Vietnamese restaurants back home, we Bun Cha All Stars now!\n\nIG @jnov_\nTiktok @jnov_reviews"

The menu was limited to bun cha and spring rolls, but that's okay, they should stick to their specialty because they are very good at making bun cha. I hope they become very successful for many years because I'm already excited to come back to this restaurant when I visit Vietnam again!"

This restaurant has perfected the dish and I couldn't even be more impressed ! I realised there were always grab food and shoppee food drivers ( equivalent to uber eats ) drivers lining to waiting outside of the restaurant to pick up their orders which meant that the locals loved the restaurant. I did another take away because it was THAT GOOD and they packed it so nicely so they did not disappoint :>>\n\nHIGHLY RECONMEND !!!!"

There are locals walking around in hoodies and jeans in this weather y‚Äôall are so different‚Ä¶\n\nWe sat upstairs and ordered Bun Cha with a spring roll (100k vnd or $4 usd), as it is essentially the only thing on the menu here. While this place is definitely geared more toward Westerners, the Bun Cha still SLAPPED. A Top 3 Bun Cha we had on our trip, and it‚Äôs definitely not 1 or 3‚Ä¶\n\nSome of the other Bun Cha we had was a little too sweet for me, but this one was perfect. Dipping the rice vermicelli noodles into the fish sauce while grabbing a piece of the minced pork shoulder before shoving it into your mouth is a spiritual experience, unique to Vietnam.\n\nThis trip to Vietnam has made me fall in love with Bun Cha. To be quite honest, I didn‚Äôt even know it existed until that episode of Parts Unknown where Obama and Bourdain ate it together in Hanoi. Even after that, I‚Äôd never tried it and kind of forgot about it. I‚Äôd stick to my normal choices at Vietnamese restaurants in the US of Pho or Banh Mi.\n\nBun Cha will be my go to order at Vietnamese restaurants back home, we Bun Cha All Stars now!\n\nIG @jnov_\nTiktok @jnov_reviews"

The menu was limited to bun cha and spring rolls, but that's okay, they should stick to their specialty because they are very good at making bun cha. I hope they become very successful for many years because I'm already excited to come back to this restaurant when I visit Vietnam again!"

While the overall experience was not bad, I must admit that the Bun Cha Ha Noi dish failed to live up to my expectations. However, I would still recommend this place for its ambiance, as long as one does not have excessively high expectations for the dish in question.\nThe staff were courteous and attentive, and the overall atmosphere was welcoming. From this perspective, the place excelled in providing a wonderful place to dine in.\nHowever, my disappointment arose when I tried the Bun Cha Ha Noi, a traditional Vietnamese dish. Although the food was good by general standards, it did not align with my prior experience of the authentic dish in Hanoi. Maybe because i had it in hanoi earlier. I believe it‚Äôs supposed to be charcoal grilled instead of electronic grill or sth in order to get mouth watering taste."

The dipping broth was bland to me, as it didn‚Äôt hit my taste buds with the umami, so it was a little disappointing. The meat patty did have a nice subtle flavour though. What satisfied me were their spring rolls - it was delicious, crunchy and flavourful. In terms of seating, I understand spaces are to be utilised efficiently, however the upstairs seating wouldn‚Äôt be ideal for those that aren‚Äôt petite, so some customers may have to wriggle themselves in tighter spots - I felt a little claustrophobic but felt better after a cold can of soft drink. Service was a little slow but the kid who took our order had good customer service."

To the owner, I am NOT a rival of another restaurant, you can read all my reviews on Google, ranging from 1 star to 5. The owner mentioned that they cut and discard the char (burnt meat), if so, they took out one of the most important part of bun cha. It is precisely the burnt that creates the bitterness into the sauce. The reason why bun cha is so good is because it has all 5 tastes; salty, sweet, sour, bitter, and umami. If you take out bitter, then it's not the same. The sauce is also too bland, fitting for foreigners. Note that I didn't say the bun cha was horrible, I simply said that the food here is WHITE-WASHED for westerners, ie, not truly authentic traditional bun cha.\n\nLet me give credit where credit is due: The \"Cha Gio\", or \"Nem Ran\", or fried spring roll is EXCELLENT !!!\n\nOriginal: I got tricked visiting this restaurant due to the good reviews; but in retrospect, it was my own fault cuz I was in a hurry. Now I re-read the reviews and realize the reviews are mostly from tourists, not locals. This place is basically a tourist trap. The bun cha isn't horribly bad, but it is FAR from GOOD, TRADITIONAL, or AUTHENTIC. The meat didn't have the good char, ie. undercooked. (It's hilarious to me when I read some others comment that the meat is good cuz it isn't burned, not understanding that the char is what makes bun cha special to create the unique taste of bun cha). The sauce is too mild, made for foreigners, not really \"traditional\". THIS PLACE IS LIKE A WHITE-WASHED VERSION OF BUN CHA. I've eaten at bun cha Huong Lien in Hanoi (u know, the one that Obama went w Bourdain), and others in Hanoi, the real traditional authentic kind. This place is not even close to \"traditional\" as in the restaurant's name. But what really ticked me off was when I asked for more veggies, they want 15k VND. It's not the money, 15k is 0.6 USD, but the fact that they try to charge tourists for veggies, veggies is so ridiculously cheap in VN, free at most restaurants when a customer wants extra. (I'm not a tourist)"

One gentleman in the back picking vegetables directed another employee to assist us and proceeded to say ‚Äúdon‚Äôt say anything in Vietnamese, they‚Äôll understand us.‚Äù Although this was blatantly rude, I brushed it off and tried to enjoy my dinner. When we finished, I asked for the check in Vietnamese to the same gentleman. He rolled his eyes at me and directed another English speaking employee to help me. Although the food was good, the condescending energy ruined my experience. It is beyond me how someone can be so rude to a customer who wanted nothing more than to support their business and  have a good dining experience. Will not be coming back unfortunately."

While the overall experience was not bad, I must admit that the Bun Cha Ha Noi dish failed to live up to my expectations. However, I would still recommend this place for its ambiance, as long as one does not have excessively high expectations for the dish in question.\nThe staff were courteous and attentive, and the overall atmosphere was welcoming. From this perspective, the place excelled in providing a wonderful place to dine in.\nHowever, my disappointment arose when I tried the Bun Cha Ha Noi, a traditional Vietnamese dish. Although the food was good by general standards, it did not align with my prior experience of the authentic dish in Hanoi. Maybe because i had it in hanoi earlier. I believe it‚Äôs supposed to be charcoal grilled instead of electronic grill or sth in order to get mouth watering taste."

                "review": "Situated in a bustling area which is good for tourists. The bun cha was ok - It‚Äôs catered more towards those that have a Western palate. The dipping broth was bland to me, as it didn‚Äôt hit my taste buds with the umami, so it was a little disappointing. The meat patty did have a nice subtle flavour though. What satisfied me were their spring rolls - it was delicious, crunchy and flavourful. In terms of seating, I understand spaces are to be utilised efficiently, however the upstairs seating wouldn‚Äôt be ideal for those that aren‚Äôt petite, so some customers may have to wriggle themselves in tighter spots - I felt a little claustrophobic but felt better after a cold can of soft drink. Service was a little slow but the kid who took our order had good customer service."

                "review": "Revision: Originally, I gave 1-star; but after reading the owner's comments, I will revise it to 3-star. The owner does make some valid arguments. To the owner, I am NOT a rival of another restaurant, you can read all my reviews on Google, ranging from 1 star to 5. The owner mentioned that they cut and discard the char (burnt meat), if so, they took out one of the most important part of bun cha. It is precisely the burnt that creates the bitterness into the sauce. The reason why bun cha is so good is because it has all 5 tastes; salty, sweet, sour, bitter, and umami. If you take out bitter, then it's not the same. The sauce is also too bland, fitting for foreigners. Note that I didn't say the bun cha was horrible, I simply said that the food here is WHITE-WASHED for westerners, ie, not truly authentic traditional bun cha.\n\nLet me give credit where credit is due: The \"Cha Gio\", or \"Nem Ran\", or fried spring roll is EXCELLENT !!!\n\nOriginal: I got tricked visiting this restaurant due to the good reviews; but in retrospect, it was my own fault cuz I was in a hurry. Now I re-read the reviews and realize the reviews are mostly from tourists, not locals. This place is basically a tourist trap. The bun cha isn't horribly bad, but it is FAR from GOOD, TRADITIONAL, or AUTHENTIC. The meat didn't have the good char, ie. undercooked. (It's hilarious to me when I read some others comment that the meat is good cuz it isn't burned, not understanding that the char is what makes bun cha special to create the unique taste of bun cha). The sauce is too mild, made for foreigners, not really \"traditional\". THIS PLACE IS LIKE A WHITE-WASHED VERSION OF BUN CHA. I've eaten at bun cha Huong Lien in Hanoi (u know, the one that Obama went w Bourdain), and others in Hanoi, the real traditional authentic kind. This place is not even close to \"traditional\" as in the restaurant's name. But what really ticked me off was when I asked for more veggies, they want 15k VND. It's not the money, 15k is 0.6 USD, but the fact that they try to charge tourists for veggies, veggies is so ridiculously cheap in VN, free at most restaurants when a customer wants extra. (I'm not a tourist)"
