The air conditioning is a definite highlight, making it an ideal spot to relax and enjoy your meal, especially on those sweltering days.\n\nFood:\nThe Bun Cha here is a delight. The grilled pork is flavorful and perfectly charred, paired with fresh vermicelli noodles, herbs, and a tangy dipping sauce that hits all the right notes. The portions are generous, ensuring you leave satisfied.\n\nIt’s an excellent choice for both locals and tourists looking to enjoy a classic Vietnamese dish in a relaxed setting.\n\nAsk for more sauce they’ll pour warm sauce for you❤️👍\nRating: 4.5"

The bun cha had plenty of meat, and the spring roll was super delicious!\nThe whole meal including drinks came up to 250k.\nOn top of everything the air conditioning was a much needed reprieve from the heat."

This restaurant has perfected the dish and I couldn't even be more impressed ! I realised there were always grab food and shoppee food drivers ( equivalent to uber eats ) drivers lining to waiting outside of the restaurant to pick up their orders which meant that the locals loved the restaurant.

There are locals walking around in hoodies and jeans in this weather y’all are so different…\n\nWe sat upstairs and ordered Bun Cha with a spring roll (100k vnd or $4 usd), as it is essentially the only thing on the menu here. While this place is definitely geared more toward Westerners, the Bun Cha still SLAPPED. A Top 3 Bun Cha we had on our trip, and it’s definitely not 1 or 3…\n\nSome of the other Bun Cha we had was a little too sweet for me, but this one was perfect. Dipping the rice vermicelli noodles into the fish sauce while grabbing a piece of the minced pork shoulder before shoving it into your mouth is a spiritual experience, unique to Vietnam.\n\nThis trip to Vietnam has made me fall in love with Bun Cha. To be quite honest, I didn’t even know it existed until that episode of Parts Unknown where Obama and Bourdain ate it together in Hanoi. Even after that, I’d never tried it and kind of forgot about it. I’d stick to my normal choices at Vietnamese restaurants in the US of Pho or Banh Mi.\n\nBun Cha will be my go to order at Vietnamese restaurants back home, we Bun Cha All Stars now!\n\nIG @jnov_\nTiktok @jnov_reviews"

Their bun cha is amazing! The orders were served very quickly and very hot. The staff was very friendly, and it was nice seeing them prepare the meat on the spot and cook it fresh. The menu was limited to bun cha and spring rolls, but that's okay, they should stick to their specialty because they are very good at making bun cha. I hope they become very successful for many years because I'm already excited to come back to this restaurant when I visit Vietnam again!"

It might be a ‘touristy’ place but with the charm of a traditional Vietnamese restaurant. The menu options are limited but all really really good at a very reasonable price tag. The bun cha had plenty of meat, and the spring roll was super delicious!\nThe whole meal including drinks came up to 250k.\nOn top of everything the air conditioning was a much needed reprieve from the heat."

This restaurant has perfected the dish and I couldn't even be more impressed ! I realised there were always grab food and shoppee food drivers ( equivalent to uber eats ) drivers lining to waiting outside of the restaurant to pick up their orders which meant that the locals loved the restaurant. I did another take away because it was THAT GOOD and they packed it so nicely so they did not disappoint :>>\n\nHIGHLY RECONMEND !!!!"

There are locals walking around in hoodies and jeans in this weather y’all are so different…\n\nWe sat upstairs and ordered Bun Cha with a spring roll (100k vnd or $4 usd), as it is essentially the only thing on the menu here. While this place is definitely geared more toward Westerners, the Bun Cha still SLAPPED. A Top 3 Bun Cha we had on our trip, and it’s definitely not 1 or 3…\n\nSome of the other Bun Cha we had was a little too sweet for me, but this one was perfect. Dipping the rice vermicelli noodles into the fish sauce while grabbing a piece of the minced pork shoulder before shoving it into your mouth is a spiritual experience, unique to Vietnam.\n\nThis trip to Vietnam has made me fall in love with Bun Cha. To be quite honest, I didn’t even know it existed until that episode of Parts Unknown where Obama and Bourdain ate it together in Hanoi. Even after that, I’d never tried it and kind of forgot about it. I’d stick to my normal choices at Vietnamese restaurants in the US of Pho or Banh Mi.\n\nBun Cha will be my go to order at Vietnamese restaurants back home, we Bun Cha All Stars now!\n\nIG @jnov_\nTiktok @jnov_reviews"

Their bun cha is amazing! The orders were served very quickly and very hot. The staff was very friendly, and it was nice seeing them prepare the meat on the spot and cook it fresh. The menu was limited to bun cha and spring rolls, but that's okay, they should stick to their specialty because they are very good at making bun cha. I hope they become very successful for many years because I'm already excited to come back to this restaurant when I visit Vietnam again!"

After searching for the best bun cha in the area and limited options at 9pm, we returned. The pork bun cha was amazing and lived up to the hype from other reviews. Only complaint is that the service was a bit pushy. the waitresss stood at our table until we ordered despite asking for a few minutes twice."

We were desperately trying to find a place for lunch to get away from the Saigon heat and were lucky enough to be near this place so we decided to try it out given the amount of good reviews - it did not disappoint. It might be a ‘touristy’ place but with the charm of a traditional Vietnamese restaurant. The menu options are limited but all really really good at a very reasonable price tag. The bun cha had plenty of meat, and the spring roll was super delicious!\nThe whole meal including drinks came up to 250k.\nOn top of everything the air conditioning was a much needed reprieve from the heat."

This restaurant has perfected the dish and I couldn't even be more impressed ! I realised there were always grab food and shoppee food drivers ( equivalent to uber eats ) drivers lining to waiting outside of the restaurant to pick up their orders which meant that the locals loved the restaurant. I did another take away because it was THAT GOOD and they packed it so nicely so they did not disappoint :>>\n\nHIGHLY RECONMEND !!!!"

There are locals walking around in hoodies and jeans in this weather y’all are so different…\n\nWe sat upstairs and ordered Bun Cha with a spring roll (100k vnd or $4 usd), as it is essentially the only thing on the menu here. While this place is definitely geared more toward Westerners, the Bun Cha still SLAPPED. A Top 3 Bun Cha we had on our trip, and it’s definitely not 1 or 3…\n\nSome of the other Bun Cha we had was a little too sweet for me, but this one was perfect. Dipping the rice vermicelli noodles into the fish sauce while grabbing a piece of the minced pork shoulder before shoving it into your mouth is a spiritual experience, unique to Vietnam.\n\nThis trip to Vietnam has made me fall in love with Bun Cha. To be quite honest, I didn’t even know it existed until that episode of Parts Unknown where Obama and Bourdain ate it together in Hanoi. Even after that, I’d never tried it and kind of forgot about it. I’d stick to my normal choices at Vietnamese restaurants in the US of Pho or Banh Mi.\n\nBun Cha will be my go to order at Vietnamese restaurants back home, we Bun Cha All Stars now!\n\nIG @jnov_\nTiktok @jnov_reviews"

Their bun cha is amazing! The orders were served very quickly and very hot. The staff was very friendly, and it was nice seeing them prepare the meat on the spot and cook it fresh. The menu was limited to bun cha and spring rolls, but that's okay, they should stick to their specialty because they are very good at making bun cha. I hope they become very successful for many years because I'm already excited to come back to this restaurant when I visit Vietnam again!"

The bun cha had plenty of meat, and the spring roll was super delicious!\nThe whole meal including drinks came up to 250k.\nOn top of everything the air conditioning was a much needed reprieve from the heat."

This restaurant has perfected the dish and I couldn't even be more impressed ! I realised there were always grab food and shoppee food drivers ( equivalent to uber eats ) drivers lining to waiting outside of the restaurant to pick up their orders which meant that the locals loved the restaurant. I did another take away because it was THAT GOOD and they packed it so nicely so they did not disappoint :>>\n\nHIGHLY RECONMEND !!!!"

There are locals walking around in hoodies and jeans in this weather y’all are so different…\n\nWe sat upstairs and ordered Bun Cha with a spring roll (100k vnd or $4 usd), as it is essentially the only thing on the menu here. While this place is definitely geared more toward Westerners, the Bun Cha still SLAPPED. A Top 3 Bun Cha we had on our trip, and it’s definitely not 1 or 3…\n\nSome of the other Bun Cha we had was a little too sweet for me, but this one was perfect. Dipping the rice vermicelli noodles into the fish sauce while grabbing a piece of the minced pork shoulder before shoving it into your mouth is a spiritual experience, unique to Vietnam.\n\nThis trip to Vietnam has made me fall in love with Bun Cha. To be quite honest, I didn’t even know it existed until that episode of Parts Unknown where Obama and Bourdain ate it together in Hanoi. Even after that, I’d never tried it and kind of forgot about it. I’d stick to my normal choices at Vietnamese restaurants in the US of Pho or Banh Mi.\n\nBun Cha will be my go to order at Vietnamese restaurants back home, we Bun Cha All Stars now!\n\nIG @jnov_\nTiktok @jnov_reviews"

Their bun cha is amazing! The orders were served very quickly and very hot. The staff was very friendly, and it was nice seeing them prepare the meat on the spot and cook it fresh. The menu was limited to bun cha and spring rolls, but that's okay, they should stick to their specialty because they are very good at making bun cha. I hope they become very successful for many years because I'm already excited to come back to this restaurant when I visit Vietnam again!"

After searching for the best bun cha in the area and limited options at 9pm, we returned. The pork bun cha was amazing and lived up to the hype from other reviews. Only complaint is that the service was a bit pushy. the waitresss stood at our table until we ordered despite asking for a few minutes twice."

We were desperately trying to find a place for lunch to get away from the Saigon heat and were lucky enough to be near this place so we decided to try it out given the amount of good reviews - it did not disappoint. It might be a ‘touristy’ place but with the charm of a traditional Vietnamese restaurant. The menu options are limited but all really really good at a very reasonable price tag. The bun cha had plenty of meat, and the spring roll was super delicious!\nThe whole meal including drinks came up to 250k.\nOn top of everything the air conditioning was a much needed reprieve from the heat."

This restaurant has perfected the dish and I couldn't even be more impressed ! I realised there were always grab food and shoppee food drivers ( equivalent to uber eats ) drivers lining to waiting outside of the restaurant to pick up their orders which meant that the locals loved the restaurant. I did another take away because it was THAT GOOD and they packed it so nicely so they did not disappoint :>>\n\nHIGHLY RECONMEND !!!!"

There are locals walking around in hoodies and jeans in this weather y’all are so different…\n\nWe sat upstairs and ordered Bun Cha with a spring roll (100k vnd or $4 usd), as it is essentially the only thing on the menu here. While this place is definitely geared more toward Westerners, the Bun Cha still SLAPPED. A Top 3 Bun Cha we had on our trip, and it’s definitely not 1 or 3…\n\nSome of the other Bun Cha we had was a little too sweet for me, but this one was perfect. Dipping the rice vermicelli noodles into the fish sauce while grabbing a piece of the minced pork shoulder before shoving it into your mouth is a spiritual experience, unique to Vietnam.\n\nThis trip to Vietnam has made me fall in love with Bun Cha. To be quite honest, I didn’t even know it existed until that episode of Parts Unknown where Obama and Bourdain ate it together in Hanoi. Even after that, I’d never tried it and kind of forgot about it. I’d stick to my normal choices at Vietnamese restaurants in the US of Pho or Banh Mi.\n\nBun Cha will be my go to order at Vietnamese restaurants back home, we Bun Cha All Stars now!\n\nIG @jnov_\nTiktok @jnov_reviews"

Their bun cha is amazing! The orders were served very quickly and very hot. The staff was very friendly, and it was nice seeing them prepare the meat on the spot and cook it fresh. The menu was limited to bun cha and spring rolls, but that's okay, they should stick to their specialty because they are very good at making bun cha. I hope they become very successful for many years because I'm already excited to come back to this restaurant when I visit Vietnam again!"

To the owner, I am NOT a rival of another restaurant, you can read all my reviews on Google, ranging from 1 star to 5. The owner mentioned that they cut and discard the char (burnt meat), if so, they took out one of the most important part of bun cha. It is precisely the burnt that creates the bitterness into the sauce. The reason why bun cha is so good is because it has all 5 tastes; salty, sweet, sour, bitter, and umami. If you take out bitter, then it's not the same. The sauce is also too bland, fitting for foreigners. Note that I didn't say the bun cha was horrible, I simply said that the food here is WHITE-WASHED for westerners, ie, not truly authentic traditional bun cha.\n\nLet me give credit where credit is due: The \"Cha Gio\", or \"Nem Ran\", or fried spring roll is EXCELLENT !!!\n\nOriginal: I got tricked visiting this restaurant due to the good reviews; but in retrospect, it was my own fault cuz I was in a hurry. Now I re-read the reviews and realize the reviews are mostly from tourists, not locals. This place is basically a tourist trap. The bun cha isn't horribly bad, but it is FAR from GOOD, TRADITIONAL, or AUTHENTIC. The meat didn't have the good char, ie. undercooked. (It's hilarious to me when I read some others comment that the meat is good cuz it isn't burned, not understanding that the char is what makes bun cha special to create the unique taste of bun cha). The sauce is too mild, made for foreigners, not really \"traditional\". THIS PLACE IS LIKE A WHITE-WASHED VERSION OF BUN CHA. I've eaten at bun cha Huong Lien in Hanoi (u know, the one that Obama went w Bourdain), and others in Hanoi, the real traditional authentic kind. This place is not even close to \"traditional\" as in the restaurant's name. But what really ticked me off was when I asked for more veggies, they want 15k VND. It's not the money, 15k is 0.6 USD, but the fact that they try to charge tourists for veggies, veggies is so ridiculously cheap in VN, free at most restaurants when a customer wants extra. (I'm not a tourist)"

When we came in, I greeted the workers in Vietnamese. One gentleman in the back picking vegetables directed another employee to assist us and proceeded to say “don’t say anything in Vietnamese, they’ll understand us.” Although this was blatantly rude, I brushed it off and tried to enjoy my dinner. When we finished, I asked for the check in Vietnamese to the same gentleman. He rolled his eyes at me and directed another English speaking employee to help me. Although the food was good, the condescending energy ruined my experience. It is beyond me how someone can be so rude to a customer who wanted nothing more than to support their business and  have a good dining experience. Will not be coming back unfortunately."

                "review": "Revision: Originally, I gave 1-star; but after reading the owner's comments, I will revise it to 3-star. The owner does make some valid arguments. To the owner, I am NOT a rival of another restaurant, you can read all my reviews on Google, ranging from 1 star to 5. The owner mentioned that they cut and discard the char (burnt meat), if so, they took out one of the most important part of bun cha. It is precisely the burnt that creates the bitterness into the sauce. The reason why bun cha is so good is because it has all 5 tastes; salty, sweet, sour, bitter, and umami. If you take out bitter, then it's not the same. The sauce is also too bland, fitting for foreigners. Note that I didn't say the bun cha was horrible, I simply said that the food here is WHITE-WASHED for westerners, ie, not truly authentic traditional bun cha.\n\nLet me give credit where credit is due: The \"Cha Gio\", or \"Nem Ran\", or fried spring roll is EXCELLENT !!!\n\nOriginal: I got tricked visiting this restaurant due to the good reviews; but in retrospect, it was my own fault cuz I was in a hurry. Now I re-read the reviews and realize the reviews are mostly from tourists, not locals. This place is basically a tourist trap. The bun cha isn't horribly bad, but it is FAR from GOOD, TRADITIONAL, or AUTHENTIC. The meat didn't have the good char, ie. undercooked. (It's hilarious to me when I read some others comment that the meat is good cuz it isn't burned, not understanding that the char is what makes bun cha special to create the unique taste of bun cha). The sauce is too mild, made for foreigners, not really \"traditional\". THIS PLACE IS LIKE A WHITE-WASHED VERSION OF BUN CHA. I've eaten at bun cha Huong Lien in Hanoi (u know, the one that Obama went w Bourdain), and others in Hanoi, the real traditional authentic kind. This place is not even close to \"traditional\" as in the restaurant's name. But what really ticked me off was when I asked for more veggies, they want 15k VND. It's not the money, 15k is 0.6 USD, but the fact that they try to charge tourists for veggies, veggies is so ridiculously cheap in VN, free at most restaurants when a customer wants extra. (I'm not a tourist)"
