Rich hot pot broth, diverse and rich toppings (chai lua, fish cake, tofu, beef, rib cartilage,...), suitable for 4 people to eat comfortably. But you also need to order one more rice cake to be full. However, the Ha Long squid patties are a bit small and the taste is not outstanding or too special. The price in my opinion is quite high at 90k for about 8-9 pieces. The stuffed snail dish is okay, a combination of snails and meat, delicious but not too special. Banh day dipped in salty fish sauce has a strange flavor and is quite delicious. The total bill of 513k is reasonable for the meal, although there are some dishes that are not really outstanding. Well, this parking spot is quite far from the restaurant and there is a TukTuk to pick you up."}, {"name": "Nhi Huynh", "time": "a month ago", "rating": "1 star", "food": "1", "service": "1", "atmosphere": "1", "review": "The 210k hot pot was terrible.

When it came time to bring it out, all three bowls were confused between having onions and not having them, having fat and not having fat. My table still patiently called the employee back to exchange, but he showed an unpleasant attitude and took the bowls to exchange. After exchanging, he turned around and slammed the bowls down on the table, making a loud noise as if to insult the customer. I was so angry that I wanted to react but my two friends stopped me. Quan has many employees and I have eaten there many times, but today I just met an uneducated employee like that. The restaurant should correct the employee's attitude. If it was a family member of the restaurant, then it would be hopeless, people from the Central region are gentle.

The service was really fast and was really friendly as we got to the restaurant. I picked a different size dish at the start and I was advised that that would be too big in comparison to the one that I picked afterwards.

The flavor of the fillings was perfect. I tried the regular banh cuon and the egg banh cuon (cooked to the way I like—no running yolk).\n\nThey have a combo dish that I would highly recommend! The combo has variations of meats (nem, sausage, egg rolls, etc) that goes well with the banh cuon. See attached picture.\n\nThere’s a huge menu on the wall for easy ordering in Vietnamese or you can show a picture from here of what you went. Staff were accommodating and can be helpful. Just be mindful it gets busy so it’s not really a place for you to sit down and chill with your friends. Turnover of tables/ seats are quick to accommodate the next guest. I came here a total of 3 times in my 7 days stay.\n\nPlease note, they have a separate sitting area across from their cooking stand.\n\nAnd during morning traffic, it can be crazy busy both with diners and people stopping to pick up to-go.\n\nBut it’s worth it!"}, {"name": "Christina Huynh", "time": "a year ago", "rating": "4 stars", "food": "N/A", "service": "N/A", "atmosphere": "N/A", "review": "This place is packed for breakfast.

Like most of the reviewers have stated. This interior is very cramped, and space is very limited. Don’t assume what people have said is an exaggeration.\n\nTo start, the staff is very quick witted. However, their communication is lacking and somewhat chaotic. I had 2 orders of meat mistakenly brought out, and a drink that was wrong. I’ll give them the benefit of the doubt, since there was so much going on. Let’s face it, a table of 15 people is too much for Vietnamese servers. In any case, the food is definitely delicious. Price is fair for what you’re getting.\n\nAll in all, if the tables are better spaced out and service isn’t so messy, I’d give this place 5 stars.

Received a package of products that looked boring.\n\nThe pork was thrown into a loose, burned paper box, not bothering to wrap it properly. When I opened it, it leaked water. It looks indescribably unkempt.\n\nThe restaurant is upscale, the prices are mid-range or higher, but the packaging is nylon bags tied with elastic bands, no different from street food.\n\nRaw vegetables are mixed with old, withered vegetables that customers have eaten and the leftovers are collected and sold to customers. Same bag of vegetables but the fresh stems were wilted like an Egyptian mummy.

The shop owner seems to stay up late a lot, her eyes are like a panda, her spirit is always tense, she grimaces without a single smile towards customers or shippers. Besides the customers, the rest of the staff, shippers, and her husband were all scolded by her.\n- The restaurant's staff are all young but talk very arrogantly. To say it politely is rude, but to say it bluntly is truly DISGUSTING. Asking 1 or 2 questions immediately shows your attitude, acting like you're being forced to go to work but you don't want to do that at all. At peak times, even though I know there is no phone network in the restaurant, I still force the delivery person to go inside to pick up the order. On top of that, I still have to click to accept the order before allowing me to pick up the goods. Without 4G, how can I operate the app??? Asking the owner of the wifi shop to operate the service would show a very unpleasant attitude. Sometimes this has to be said because the luck is coming for the two of them to do business. But with that attitude and that staff, the store would have been closed 8 lifetimes ago. I'm also from Nha Trang - Khanh Hoa and came to Saigon to live and work, but seeing you two like that makes me so ashamed for the people of Khanh Hoa.\n- As for the car maintenance part, in the past, he was the car maintenance contractor. Then an old man came out to help, but his attitude was like the customer had to serve him, not him serving the customer. I only know how to sit in one place and point 5 fingers to tell customers and shippers where to park and then let people push the car and pick it up themselves. There was no pushing for customers or showing a friendly attitude towards serving customers. If you park in the wrong place, you'll hear him curse, even if you're a customer, you'll still hear curses (Yet, many people still wait in line to eat, that's great). If you don't know what to ask, he won't answer even if he listens to you. It's like being born deaf.\n- In general, I don't know how the restaurant does business, but the bald owner seems to have been beaten by the shipper several times. Actually, I should have beaten the owner and those rude employees, but because we are girls and women, you forgive us :)))))\n\nIf the shop owner reads this article, please improve his way of working, but I find that my shop has many shortcomings. Truthful words are unpopular, if you don't change them, you'll lose customers sooner or later.\n\nFriendly welcome!!!"}, {"name": "Vy Phạm", "time": "3 months ago", "rating": "1 star", "food": "N/A", "service": "1", "atmosphere": "1", "review": "The staff has an attitude that doesn't care about customers and talks nonsense.

However, my friend drank most of it and was afraid I wouldn't drink it, so he stood up and went to the counter to ask the staff for more tea. I understood that I was going with 2 people and felt like I needed to drink a lot of water. You can order 2 drinks from the beginning, so if the shop refuses to refill, I have no idea, but instead of politely refusing, the shop owner asks his friend again in a very loud voice, \"I see you're drinking.\" A cup of tea costs 3k, should I ask for more? If I ask for more, I'll give you 3k\"?????? When I finished paying, because I was transferring money, the owner and employee, instead of paying me and seeing that I was transferring money, they should proactively remind each other to check and notify me, but no, they didn't tell each other to check and waited. My friend and I stood up and shouted in the middle of the restaurant, \"Hey, is that 106k table charged yet? Wait a minute.\" Oh my God, I feel like I spend money to eat, I don't steal or beg, but they give me very negative emotions.\nIf you want to try the food, that's fine, but don't expect anything from the experience and if you're sensitive, I advise you not to try it because you'll only be annoyed by trying it."}, {"name": "Hien Tran", "time": "5 months ago", "rating": "1 star", "food": "1", "service": "1", "atmosphere": "N/A", "review": "The shop prioritizes selling customers on-site, but the waiting time is quite long.

I think the noodles are just enough to roll the rice paper with the other toppings.\nThe dipping sauce bowl is peanut sauce. Bui is fat.

But when dipped in spring rolls, the other toppings mix together to reduce the sweetness of the sauce, so I eat it very deliciously. With 2 portions like this, I think 1 weak eater and 1 strong eater would be nice. 130k for this quality, I think the price is reasonable.\nFried spring rolls into small pieces, drained of oil. I found it delicious without the smell of old oil but it didn't leave any impression because it was like other restaurants I've eaten at.\nThe tapioca cake is chewy but the shrimp and meat inside are not yet soaked in seasoning. Banh nam is filled with pureed green beans. Anyone who likes the richness of beans will like it.\n* Summary: Cool space, pleasant feeling, decent service, quality food at reasonable prices. 2 people can eat until they are full without leaving any food behind.
