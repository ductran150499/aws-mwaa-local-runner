The owner thought I was criticizing the old water so he said it was new water for customers to buy. When I arrived, the customer didn't eat the onion so he left it behind. But because I don't like eating food in plastic bags/styrofoam boxes. The shop owner still happily exchanged it for me without any attitude.\nIn addition, this dish also includes bananas, because the shop owner bought it to support the banana seller.

But it seems the shop has had enough customers so now the owner has changed her tone.\nIn the past, no matter how elegant and polite, if I were to sell my time, I would probably lose it all along with a few bowls of beef noodle soup. Extremely bad attitude, in recent months I have visited 5 times, 2 times I saw the owner having an attitude towards other tables, 2 times she had an attitude towards my own table & the peak was today. At first I thought she was joking, then I saw she was rude, and later I saw she was intentionally trying to show people how polite she was. I've given the restaurant too many chances, but every time I come and leave, I feel frustrated, eating a bowl of vermicelli and paying for it makes me feel angry. The three recent reviews are probably all self-posted and self-voted. I don't understand how anyone could praise the landlady for being civilized."

I've eaten there many times, but today I saw the owner pouring water from a plastic wrap into my bowl and I immediately asked to change the water. The owner thought I was criticizing the old water so he said it was new water for customers to buy. When I arrived, the customer didn't eat the onion so he left it behind. But because I don't like eating food in plastic bags/styrofoam boxes. The shop owner still happily exchanged it for me without any attitude.\nIn addition, this dish also includes bananas, because the shop owner bought it to support the banana seller. Add 1d plus for the shop"

I've eaten there many times, but today I saw the owner pouring water from a plastic wrap into my bowl and I immediately asked to change the water. The owner thought I was criticizing the old water so he said it was new water for customers to buy. When I arrived, the customer didn't eat the onion so he left it behind. But because I don't like eating food in plastic bags/styrofoam boxes. The shop owner still happily exchanged it for me without any attitude.\nIn addition, this dish also includes bananas, because the shop owner bought it to support the banana seller. Add 1d plus for the shop"

However, the restaurant puts the ingredients and common dishwashing area near the dining table, so it doesn't look very aesthetically pleasing, and the dining table is clean.\nThe owner is friendly and pleasant. I've eaten there many times, but today I saw the owner pouring water from a plastic wrap into my bowl and I immediately asked to change the water. The owner thought I was criticizing the old water so he said it was new water for customers to buy. When I arrived, the customer didn't eat the onion so he left it behind. But because I don't like eating food in plastic bags/styrofoam boxes. The shop owner still happily exchanged it for me without any attitude.\nIn addition, this dish also includes bananas, because the shop owner bought it to support the banana seller. Add 1d plus for the shop"

Reasonable price from 35k, free iced tea, medium and slightly sweet broth. However, people often forget dishes.

Talking about the serving size, the topping is very good, 3 large soft pieces and the patty is firm.

The owner thought I was criticizing the old water so he said it was new water for customers to buy. When I arrived, the customer didn't eat the onion so he left it behind. But because I don't like eating food in plastic bags/styrofoam boxes. The shop owner still happily exchanged it for me without any attitude.\nIn addition, this dish also includes bananas, because the shop owner bought it to support the banana seller.

To get to the restaurant by motorbike or car is a bit difficult because the road is very small. The most delicious here are the cartilage and tendons. Reasonable price from 35k, free iced tea, medium and slightly sweet broth. However, people often forget dishes.

To get to the restaurant by motorbike or car is a bit difficult because the road is very small. The most delicious here are the cartilage and tendons. Reasonable price from 35k, free iced tea, medium and slightly sweet broth. However, people often forget dishes. When eating, remember to repeat them many times or the restaurant will get the wrong dish."

I've eaten there many times, but today I saw the owner pouring water from a plastic wrap into my bowl and I immediately asked to change the water. The owner thought I was criticizing the old water so he said it was new water for customers to buy. When I arrived, the customer didn't eat the onion so he left it behind. But because I don't like eating food in plastic bags/styrofoam boxes. The shop owner still happily exchanged it for me without any attitude.\nIn addition, this dish also includes bananas, because the shop owner bought it to support the banana seller. Add 1d plus for the shop"

I've eaten there many times, but today I saw the owner pouring water from a plastic wrap into my bowl and I immediately asked to change the water. The owner thought I was criticizing the old water so he said it was new water for customers to buy. When I arrived, the customer didn't eat the onion so he left it behind. But because I don't like eating food in plastic bags/styrofoam boxes. The shop owner still happily exchanged it for me without any attitude.\nIn addition, this dish also includes bananas, because the shop owner bought it to support the banana seller.

Extremely bad attitude, in recent months I have visited 5 times, 2 times I saw the owner having an attitude towards other tables, 2 times she had an attitude towards my own table & the peak was today. At first I thought she was joking, then I saw she was rude, and later I saw she was intentionally trying to show people how polite she was. I've given the restaurant too many chances, but every time I come and leave, I feel frustrated, eating a bowl of vermicelli and paying for it makes me feel angry. The three recent reviews are probably all self-posted and self-voted. I don't understand how anyone could praise the landlady for being civilized."

The shop is a bit small, seating is a bit cramped. The shop owner told me again (because I ordered a mixed bag, but he said I had to order each item clearly like the menu), so I didn't really see it, minus 1 star."

However, the restaurant puts the ingredients and common dishwashing area near the dining table, so it doesn't look very aesthetically pleasing, and the dining table is clean.\nThe owner is friendly and pleasant. I've eaten there many times, but today I saw the owner pouring water from a plastic wrap into my bowl and I immediately asked to change the water. The owner thought I was criticizing the old water so he said it was new water for customers to buy. When I arrived, the customer didn't eat the onion so he left it behind. But because I don't like eating food in plastic bags/styrofoam boxes. The shop owner still happily exchanged it for me without any attitude.\nIn addition, this dish also includes bananas, because the shop owner bought it to support the banana seller. Add 1d plus for the shop"

To get to the restaurant by motorbike or car is a bit difficult because the road is very small. The most delicious here are the cartilage and tendons. Reasonable price from 35k, free iced tea, medium and slightly sweet broth. However, people often forget dishes. When eating, remember to repeat them many times or the restaurant will get the wrong dish."
