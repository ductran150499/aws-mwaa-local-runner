Rich hot pot broth, diverse and rich toppings (chai lua, fish cake, tofu, beef, rib cartilage,...), suitable for 4 people to eat comfortably. But you also need to order one more rice cake to be full. However, the Ha Long squid patties are a bit small and the taste is not outstanding or too special. The price in my opinion is quite high at 90k for about 8-9 pieces. The stuffed snail dish is okay, a combination of snails and meat, delicious but not too special. Banh day dipped in salty fish sauce has a strange flavor and is quite delicious. The total bill of 513k is reasonable for the meal, although there are some dishes that are not really outstanding. Well, this parking spot is quite far from the restaurant and there is a TukTuk to pick you up."

I've really liked this restaurant for a long time. I like the chicken feet, squid teeth, etc., all very delicious, but this time I came back it was so bad."

If you don't feel full, order crab hotpot. beef shank (because the fish cake is eaten with vermicelli, if you add hot pot it seems full)\nRegarding the taste, I find it quite oke, true to the spirit of northern dishes.\nAh, the parking lot is far away but there is a tram to pick you up so it's okay.\nThe restaurant should go at 6pm because it will be a bit crowded later."

Order a portion of pho rolls, squid teeth with garlic, sweet potato cocoon, crab meat hotpot, lemon tea, kumquat tea. Pho rolls are bad! It's all vegetables, the meat is shriveled in a few pieces but still smells like meat. The cocooned sweet potatoes are hard because they are covered with a thick dough shell. Squid teeth are edible. Lemon tea, kumquat tea are bad. The hot pot is okay, there are quite a lot of toppings. But it's really not delicious. But the most impressive thing is probably the PARKING FEE 🙂 When paying, the staff asked how many motorbikes. I said to take 3 cars, thinking the shop would give me a card for free parking BUT NO! INertia ALWAYS HAS TO RETAIN THE CAR IN THE BILL 5K/VEHICLE :)))) It's really hard to help! Eat once... NEVER GO BACK 😊 The restaurant has no parking space, forcing customers to walk a long way (Hoa Binh Tourism Company) to park their cars is already a big inconvenience for customers, and they also have to pay a deposit. Car collects bill. I'm speechless 😏 It's better to collect money right at the parking lot, it's less frustrating :)) It's so strange to do business!!! My friend's face stiffened after eating and her lips popped but she had no feeling. The restaurant's hotpot probably has a lot of MSG in it."

If it was too sour, you would pour in filtered water and it would become nothing. The spring rolls also felt a bit sour as if they were about to spoil. I've really liked this restaurant for a long time. I like the chicken feet, squid teeth, etc., all very delicious, but this time I came back it was so bad."

If you don't feel full, order crab hotpot. beef shank (because the fish cake is eaten with vermicelli, if you add hot pot it seems full)\nRegarding the taste, I find it quite oke, true to the spirit of northern dishes.\nAh, the parking lot is far away but there is a tram to pick you up so it's okay.\nThe restaurant should go at 6pm because it will be a bit crowded later."

Order a portion of pho rolls, squid teeth with garlic, sweet potato cocoon, crab meat hotpot, lemon tea, kumquat tea. Pho rolls are bad! It's all vegetables, the meat is shriveled in a few pieces but still smells like meat. The cocooned sweet potatoes are hard because they are covered with a thick dough shell. Squid teeth are edible. Lemon tea, kumquat tea are bad. The hot pot is okay, there are quite a lot of toppings. But it's really not delicious. But the most impressive thing is probably the PARKING FEE 🙂 When paying, the staff asked how many motorbikes. I said to take 3 cars, thinking the shop would give me a card for free parking BUT NO! INertia ALWAYS HAS TO RETAIN THE CAR IN THE BILL 5K/VEHICLE :)))) It's really hard to help! Eat once... NEVER GO BACK 😊 The restaurant has no parking space, forcing customers to walk a long way (Hoa Binh Tourism Company) to park their cars is already a big inconvenience for customers, and they also have to pay a deposit. Car collects bill. I'm speechless 😏 It's better to collect money right at the parking lot, it's less frustrating :)) It's so strange to do business!!! My friend's face stiffened after eating and her lips popped but she had no feeling. The restaurant's hotpot probably has a lot of MSG in it."

We sat on the second floor and it was quite fresh there."

Rich hot pot broth, diverse and rich toppings (chai lua, fish cake, tofu, beef, rib cartilage,...), suitable for 4 people to eat comfortably. But you also need to order one more rice cake to be full. However, the Ha Long squid patties are a bit small and the taste is not outstanding or too special. The price in my opinion is quite high at 90k for about 8-9 pieces. The stuffed snail dish is okay, a combination of snails and meat, delicious but not too special. Banh day dipped in salty fish sauce has a strange flavor and is quite delicious. The total bill of 513k is reasonable for the meal, although there are some dishes that are not really outstanding. Well, this parking spot is quite far from the restaurant and there is a TukTuk to pick you up."

If you don't feel full, order crab hotpot. beef shank (because the fish cake is eaten with vermicelli, if you add hot pot it seems full)\nRegarding the taste, I find it quite oke, true to the spirit of northern dishes.\nAh, the parking lot is far away but there is a tram to pick you up so it's okay.\nThe restaurant should go at 6pm because it will be a bit crowded later."

The parking lot is far from the restaurant, but the special thing about this place is that there are tuktuks to pick up customers.\n\nI thought this place would serve very late, but the kitchen closes around 10:15 p.m. So I made myself a pretty bad cup of dracontomelon.\n\nThe total damage for 2 drunk people ranged from 500K"

Rich hot pot broth, diverse and rich toppings (chai lua, fish cake, tofu, beef, rib cartilage,...), suitable for 4 people to eat comfortably. But you also need to order one more rice cake to be full. However, the Ha Long squid patties are a bit small and the taste is not outstanding or too special. The price in my opinion is quite high at 90k for about 8-9 pieces. The stuffed snail dish is okay, a combination of snails and meat, delicious but not too special. Banh day dipped in salty fish sauce has a strange flavor and is quite delicious. The total bill of 513k is reasonable for the meal, although there are some dishes that are not really outstanding. Well, this parking spot is quite far from the restaurant and there is a TukTuk to pick you up."

If you don't feel full, order crab hotpot. beef shank (because the fish cake is eaten with vermicelli, if you add hot pot it seems full)\nRegarding the taste, I find it quite oke, true to the spirit of northern dishes.\nAh, the parking lot is far away but there is a tram to pick you up so it's okay.\nThe restaurant should go at 6pm because it will be a bit crowded later."

Order a portion of pho rolls, squid teeth with garlic, sweet potato cocoon, crab meat hotpot, lemon tea, kumquat tea. Pho rolls are bad! It's all vegetables, the meat is shriveled in a few pieces but still smells like meat. The cocooned sweet potatoes are hard because they are covered with a thick dough shell. Squid teeth are edible. Lemon tea, kumquat tea are bad. The hot pot is okay, there are quite a lot of toppings. But it's really not delicious. But the most impressive thing is probably the PARKING FEE 🙂 When paying, the staff asked how many motorbikes. I said to take 3 cars, thinking the shop would give me a card for free parking BUT NO! INertia ALWAYS HAS TO RETAIN THE CAR IN THE BILL 5K/VEHICLE :)))) It's really hard to help! Eat once... NEVER GO BACK 😊 The restaurant has no parking space, forcing customers to walk a long way (Hoa Binh Tourism Company) to park their cars is already a big inconvenience for customers, and they also have to pay a deposit. Car collects bill. I'm speechless 😏 It's better to collect money right at the parking lot, it's less frustrating :)) It's so strange to do business!!! My friend's face stiffened after eating and her lips popped but she had no feeling. The restaurant's hotpot probably has a lot of MSG in it."

When the guy in my team asked, \"Do you charge a fee to park your car?\", the white male friend, wearing a floral short-sleeved shirt, replied, \"Oh my god, why don't you charge me a fee to park your car?\" charge.\" - Speak in a very disrespectful way to customers!

The seating area is not comfortable. If you want to eat, you have to wait quite a long time. Second, the food is nothing special. My table of 4 people ordered chicken feet, fried squid with fish sauce, squid rolls, fish balls, hot pot, and some other miscellaneous dishes, according to everyone's reviews. In the group, except for the squid rolls, it was ok, the rest were just average. Especially, many people said that the hotpot was very delicious, but the experience was nothing but one word \"BAD\", to summarize: the food was not as good as said. The station of the rw saints went online, the space was cramped and frustrating because the shop was very crowded. And after the whole group finished eating, that night and the next morning everyone let off fireworks loudly. At first, they thought it was just them because they were afraid of having a weak stomach, but the whole group was being treated (maybe the whole group had a weak stomach@@). ). The only plus point of the restaurant is that the food comes out quickly... everything else, if you want to come and experience it, just come and have your own feeling!"

First of all, I admit that the restaurant's food is okay, not bad and not expensive. But I give this shop 1 star because: the group drank 16 bottles of brown tiger, inertia 18 bottles, 4 other people came in after an hour of drinking 14 bottles of silver tiger, calculated as 18 bottles (while 1 bottle in the shop costs 20k). Next, 9 people use 9 cold towels, which is 22. Where did 9 people bring out 22 cold towels? When it was time to leave to get the car, I couldn't calm down. I gave the ticket to the security guys and they asked me where my car was. I told them earlier that they said I should put the guard on the sidewalk and then they led me here. How did I know? He asked for the license plate number of the car and so I had to go find it myself, but they just stood there. Once you go to this restaurant, you will never return."

It's all vegetables, the meat is shriveled in a few pieces but still smells like meat. The cocooned sweet potatoes are hard because they are covered with a thick dough shell. Squid teeth are edible. Lemon tea, kumquat tea are bad. The hot pot is okay, there are quite a lot of toppings. But it's really not delicious. But the most impressive thing is probably the PARKING FEE 🙂 When paying, the staff asked how many motorbikes. I said to take 3 cars, thinking the shop would give me a card for free parking BUT NO! INertia ALWAYS HAS TO RETAIN THE CAR IN THE BILL 5K/VEHICLE :)))) It's really hard to help! Eat once... NEVER GO BACK 😊 The restaurant has no parking space, forcing customers to walk a long way (Hoa Binh Tourism Company) to park their cars is already a big inconvenience for customers, and they also have to pay a deposit. Car collects bill. I'm speechless 😏 It's better to collect money right at the parking lot, it's less frustrating :)) It's so strange to do business!!! My friend's face stiffened after eating and her lips popped but she had no feeling. The restaurant's hotpot probably has a lot of MSG in it."

When the guy in my team asked, \"Do you charge a fee to park your car?\", the white male friend, wearing a floral short-sleeved shirt, replied, \"Oh my god, why don't you charge me a fee to park your car?\" charge.\" - Speak in a very disrespectful way to customers!

The seating area is not comfortable. If you want to eat, you have to wait quite a long time. Second, the food is nothing special. My table of 4 people ordered chicken feet, fried squid with fish sauce, squid rolls, fish balls, hot pot, and some other miscellaneous dishes, according to everyone's reviews. In the group, except for the squid rolls, it was ok, the rest were just average. Especially, many people said that the hotpot was very delicious, but the experience was nothing but one word \"BAD\", to summarize: the food was not as good as said. The station of the rw saints went online, the space was cramped and frustrating because the shop was very crowded. And after the whole group finished eating, that night and the next morning everyone let off fireworks loudly. At first, they thought it was just them because they were afraid of having a weak stomach, but the whole group was being treated (maybe the whole group had a weak stomach@@). ). The only plus point of the restaurant is that the food comes out quickly... everything else, if you want to come and experience it, just come and have your own feeling!"

First of all, I admit that the restaurant's food is okay, not bad and not expensive. But I give this shop 1 star because: the group drank 16 bottles of brown tiger, inertia 18 bottles, 4 other people came in after an hour of drinking 14 bottles of silver tiger, calculated as 18 bottles (while 1 bottle in the shop costs 20k). Next, 9 people use 9 cold towels, which is 22. Where did 9 people bring out 22 cold towels? When it was time to leave to get the car, I couldn't calm down. I gave the ticket to the security guys and they asked me where my car was. I told them earlier that they said I should put the guard on the sidewalk and then they led me here. How did I know? He asked for the license plate number of the car and so I had to go find it myself, but they just stood there. Once you go to this restaurant, you will never return."

It's all vegetables, the meat is shriveled in a few pieces but still smells like meat. The cocooned sweet potatoes are hard because they are covered with a thick dough shell. Squid teeth are edible. Lemon tea, kumquat tea are bad. The hot pot is okay, there are quite a lot of toppings. But it's really not delicious. But the most impressive thing is probably the PARKING FEE 🙂 When paying, the staff asked how many motorbikes. I said to take 3 cars, thinking the shop would give me a card for free parking BUT NO! INertia ALWAYS HAS TO RETAIN THE CAR IN THE BILL 5K/VEHICLE :)))) It's really hard to help! Eat once... NEVER GO BACK 😊 The restaurant has no parking space, forcing customers to walk a long way (Hoa Binh Tourism Company) to park their cars is already a big inconvenience for customers, and they also have to pay a deposit. Car collects bill. I'm speechless 😏 It's better to collect money right at the parking lot, it's less frustrating :)) It's so strange to do business!!! My friend's face stiffened after eating and her lips popped but she had no feeling. The restaurant's hotpot probably has a lot of MSG in it."

When the guy in my team asked, \"Do you charge a fee to park your car?\", the white male friend, wearing a floral short-sleeved shirt, replied, \"Oh my god, why don't you charge me a fee to park your car?\" charge.\" - Speak in a very disrespectful way to customers!

The seating area is not comfortable. If you want to eat, you have to wait quite a long time. Second, the food is nothing special. My table of 4 people ordered chicken feet, fried squid with fish sauce, squid rolls, fish balls, hot pot, and some other miscellaneous dishes, according to everyone's reviews. In the group, except for the squid rolls, it was ok, the rest were just average. Especially, many people said that the hotpot was very delicious, but the experience was nothing but one word \"BAD\", to summarize: the food was not as good as said. The station of the rw saints went online, the space was cramped and frustrating because the shop was very crowded. And after the whole group finished eating, that night and the next morning everyone let off fireworks loudly. At first, they thought it was just them because they were afraid of having a weak stomach, but the whole group was being treated (maybe the whole group had a weak stomach@@). ). The only plus point of the restaurant is that the food comes out quickly... everything else, if you want to come and experience it, just come and have your own feeling!"

First of all, I admit that the restaurant's food is okay, not bad and not expensive. But I give this shop 1 star because: the group drank 16 bottles of brown tiger, inertia 18 bottles, 4 other people came in after an hour of drinking 14 bottles of silver tiger, calculated as 18 bottles (while 1 bottle in the shop costs 20k). Next, 9 people use 9 cold towels, which is 22. Where did 9 people bring out 22 cold towels? When it was time to leave to get the car, I couldn't calm down. I gave the ticket to the security guys and they asked me where my car was. I told them earlier that they said I should put the guard on the sidewalk and then they led me here. How did I know? He asked for the license plate number of the car and so I had to go find it myself, but they just stood there. Once you go to this restaurant, you will never return."
