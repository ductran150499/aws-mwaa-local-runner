My sister told me to order 2 pots of squid without shrimp. The waiter brought it back while walking away, muttering \"Let's hold on,\" a bit. When I brought out the same 2 bowls, my sister said the wrong thing, then another friend said to take the shrimp and put it on the other table for her. Because of the mix up, the other person already ate it, I really don't know! I won't say anything about the mistake, but I can't accept the attitude of \"let the customer wait\". When I commented, another waitress came out to apologize on my behalf, but the person who said that still walked back and forth like nothing, not apologizing at all.\nThe food is also normal, the service attitude is so bad, I will say goodbye and see you again (squid noodle soup Old Man Cali Phan Xich Long)"

The restaurant was not crowded but the staff was very confused in serving and serving customers. The food was all mixed up. When we brought the food to our table, it was mixed up. My sister told me to order 2 pots of squid without shrimp. The waiter brought it back while walking away, muttering \"Let's hold on,\" a bit. When I brought out the same 2 bowls, my sister said the wrong thing, then another friend said to take the shrimp and put it on the other table for her. Because of the mix up, the other person already ate it, I really don't know! I won't say anything about the mistake, but I can't accept the attitude of \"let the customer wait\". When I commented, another waitress came out to apologize on my behalf, but the person who said that still walked back and forth like nothing, not apologizing at all.\nThe food is also normal, the service attitude is so bad, I will say goodbye and see you again (squid noodle soup Old Man Cali Phan Xich Long)"

In front of the restaurant, it said \"Special: Dried rice noodles\" so I went in and ordered a bowl (price 50K).\n- I ate dinner around 9:30 p.m., it was still quite crowded.\n- The sales staff must have worked a lot and was tired, so from the time I came in until I paid, even though I thanked her and interacted, she didn't say a word, she just quietly did it and gave it to me. From the moment I placed the order, she didn't nod at all, so I didn't know if the order had been completed yet\n- Another girl was counting money and scrolling through the phone (pretending to be a shop owner), this girl was probably the shop owner\n- In terms of taste, this dish is delicious because of the noodles, cooked so that it is soft, not too tough or hard. As for the bowl of broth and toppings, I find it stable, not too special and not too bad\n- Topping includes kidney, pork, shrimp, light and moderate broth. In general, everything is okay (for me)\n- On the table there is hoisin sauce, chili sauce and sweet sate chili like the type of Quang noodle soup that is often eaten in the Central region, it is also interesting to use as a dipping sauce.\n- I tried it to see if I could eat it again, but I don't necessarily have to eat it again"

In front of the restaurant, it said \"Special: Dried rice noodles\" so I went in and ordered a bowl (price 50K).\n- I ate dinner around 9:30 p.m., it was still quite crowded.\n- The sales staff must have worked a lot and was tired, so from the time I came in until I paid, even though I thanked her and interacted, she didn't say a word, she just quietly did it and gave it to me. From the moment I placed the order, she didn't nod at all, so I didn't know if the order had been completed yet\n- Another girl was counting money and scrolling through the phone (pretending to be a shop owner), this girl was probably the shop owner\n- In terms of taste, this dish is delicious because of the noodles, cooked so that it is soft, not too tough or hard. As for the bowl of broth and toppings, I find it stable, not too special and not too bad\n- Topping includes kidney, pork, shrimp, light and moderate broth. In general, everything is okay (for me)\n- On the table there is hoisin sauce, chili sauce and sweet sate chili like the type of Quang noodle soup that is often eaten in the Central region, it is also interesting to use as a dipping sauce.\n- I tried it to see if I could eat it again, but I don't necessarily have to eat it again"

How could I carry the bag of water back? It's ok to ignore it.\nThe second time today, at 10:30 p.m., I also asked for the bill because I asked for more food, so I had shrimp and eggs left over in the bowl of soup, but my friend left out the extra meat for me to take home. I brought the bowl back and asked her to put it in the bag. She said again, what else did she ask for the bag to bring back? I didn't bother to say it because I was afraid to ask to go home so I didn't say anything again. She continued to repeat the same sentence while pouring water for herself. The bag was still slurping, so she put it in for herself and left the whole piece of heart in the bowl, she thought it was okay to leave it there. If you still regret the bag you brought home when selling, please tell me so I won't ask for it next time. If the noodle soup is bad or doesn't have any meat left, why should I go home? It really doesn't matter how good it is, but if you don't respect the customer, that's bad. Hope the owner cares more about her customers."

In front of the restaurant, it said \"Special: Dried rice noodles\" so I went in and ordered a bowl (price 50K).\n- I ate dinner around 9:30 p.m., it was still quite crowded.\n- The sales staff must have worked a lot and was tired, so from the time I came in until I paid, even though I thanked her and interacted, she didn't say a word, she just quietly did it and gave it to me. From the moment I placed the order, she didn't nod at all, so I didn't know if the order had been completed yet\n- Another girl was counting money and scrolling through the phone (pretending to be a shop owner), this girl was probably the shop owner\n- In terms of taste, this dish is delicious because of the noodles, cooked so that it is soft, not too tough or hard. As for the bowl of broth and toppings, I find it stable, not too special and not too bad\n- Topping includes kidney, pork, shrimp, light and moderate broth. In general, everything is okay (for me)\n- On the table there is hoisin sauce, chili sauce and sweet sate chili like the type of Quang noodle soup that is often eaten in the Central region, it is also interesting to use as a dipping sauce.\n- I tried it to see if I could eat it again, but I don't necessarily have to eat it again"

How could I carry the bag of water back? It's ok to ignore it.\nThe second time today, at 10:30 p.m., I also asked for the bill because I asked for more food, so I had shrimp and eggs left over in the bowl of soup, but my friend left out the extra meat for me to take home. I brought the bowl back and asked her to put it in the bag. She said again, what else did she ask for the bag to bring back? I didn't bother to say it because I was afraid to ask to go home so I didn't say anything again. She continued to repeat the same sentence while pouring water for herself. The bag was still slurping, so she put it in for herself and left the whole piece of heart in the bowl, she thought it was okay to leave it there. If you still regret the bag you brought home when selling, please tell me so I won't ask for it next time. If the noodle soup is bad or doesn't have any meat left, why should I go home? It really doesn't matter how good it is, but if you don't respect the customer, that's bad. Hope the owner cares more about her customers."

How could I carry the bag of water back? It's ok to ignore it.\nThe second time today, at 10:30 p.m., I also asked for the bill because I asked for more food, so I had shrimp and eggs left over in the bowl of soup, but my friend left out the extra meat for me to take home. I brought the bowl back and asked her to put it in the bag. She said again, what else did she ask for the bag to bring back? I didn't bother to say it because I was afraid to ask to go home so I didn't say anything again. She continued to repeat the same sentence while pouring water for herself. The bag was still slurping, so she put it in for herself and left the whole piece of heart in the bowl, she thought it was okay to leave it there. If you still regret the bag you brought home when selling, please tell me so I won't ask for it next time. If the noodle soup is bad or doesn't have any meat left, why should I go home? It really doesn't matter how good it is, but if you don't respect the customer, that's bad. Hope the owner cares more about her customers."

From the moment I placed the order, she didn't nod at all, so I didn't know if the order had been completed yet\n- Another girl was counting money and scrolling through the phone (pretending to be a shop owner), this girl was probably the shop owner\n- In terms of taste, this dish is delicious because of the noodles, cooked so that it is soft, not too tough or hard. As for the bowl of broth and toppings, I find it stable, not too special and not too bad\n- Topping includes kidney, pork, shrimp, light and moderate broth. In general, everything is okay (for me)\n- On the table there is hoisin sauce, chili sauce and sweet sate chili like the type of Quang noodle soup that is often eaten in the Central region, it is also interesting to use as a dipping sauce.\n- I tried it to see if I could eat it again, but I don't necessarily have to eat it again"

How could I carry the bag of water back? It's ok to ignore it.\nThe second time today, at 10:30 p.m., I also asked for the bill because I asked for more food, so I had shrimp and eggs left over in the bowl of soup, but my friend left out the extra meat for me to take home. I brought the bowl back and asked her to put it in the bag. She said again, what else did she ask for the bag to bring back? I didn't bother to say it because I was afraid to ask to go home so I didn't say anything again. She continued to repeat the same sentence while pouring water for herself. The bag was still slurping, so she put it in for herself and left the whole piece of heart in the bowl, she thought it was okay to leave it there. If you still regret the bag you brought home when selling, please tell me so I won't ask for it next time. If the noodle soup is bad or doesn't have any meat left, why should I go home? It really doesn't matter how good it is, but if you don't respect the customer, that's bad. Hope the owner cares more about her customers."

How could I carry the bag of water back? It's ok to ignore it.\nThe second time today, at 10:30 p.m., I also asked for the bill because I asked for more food, so I had shrimp and eggs left over in the bowl of soup, but my friend left out the extra meat for me to take home. I brought the bowl back and asked her to put it in the bag. She said again, what else did she ask for the bag to bring back? I didn't bother to say it because I was afraid to ask to go home so I didn't say anything again. She continued to repeat the same sentence while pouring water for herself. The bag was still slurping, so she put it in for herself and left the whole piece of heart in the bowl, she thought it was okay to leave it there. If you still regret the bag you brought home when selling, please tell me so I won't ask for it next time. If the noodle soup is bad or doesn't have any meat left, why should I go home? It really doesn't matter how good it is, but if you don't respect the customer, that's bad. Hope the owner cares more about her customers."

How could I carry the bag of water back? It's ok to ignore it.\nThe second time today, at 10:30 p.m., I also asked for the bill because I asked for more food, so I had shrimp and eggs left over in the bowl of soup, but my friend left out the extra meat for me to take home. I brought the bowl back and asked her to put it in the bag. She said again, what else did she ask for the bag to bring back? I didn't bother to say it because I was afraid to ask to go home so I didn't say anything again. She continued to repeat the same sentence while pouring water for herself. The bag was still slurping, so she put it in for herself and left the whole piece of heart in the bowl, she thought it was okay to leave it there. If you still regret the bag you brought home when selling, please tell me so I won't ask for it next time. If the noodle soup is bad or doesn't have any meat left, why should I go home? It really doesn't matter how good it is, but if you don't respect the customer, that's bad. Hope the owner cares more about her customers."
